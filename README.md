ITP Project 
The Institute has decided to create a web application using the MERN technology stack to automate processes, provide online services, and leverage the latest technology and best practices in software development. The project aims to provide good education at a low cost, seek new opportunities, offer virtual appointments between students, teachers, and parents, provide a convenient payment gateway, and expand the online student base. The solution overview involves building a web application that automates and manages various institute processes such as student management, staff management, timetable and notice management, class fee management, module management, quiz management, assignment management, and support services management.
