# Online-Educational-Institute-Management-System-_ITP
ITP Project 
our project we are using the waterwall method as the design methodology. First, we gathered 
all the requirements we need to understand the project and we created a design as a blueprint. After 
that we are planning to do the implementation of the system. After completing the implementation, 
we planning to do the verifications by testing the web application. If the system is not verified, we 
are fixing the errors that cause the verification to fail. After the verification is completed, we are 
planning to deploy the system so the Institute can use the system for their required purposes. After 
deploying, we have the responsibility of maintaining the system in its lifespan. If there is any error
in the system, we are taking the necessary actions to fix the error and restore the web application 
on its optimal execution.
